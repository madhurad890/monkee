<h1>Street Monkee Studios</h1>
<p> Street Monkee Studios is a music review company based out of Houston, Texas. The studio was founded by music industry leaders Madhura Deshpande, Juliana Ramirez, Mia Semeniuk, and Haya Tawfik. The idea for Street Monkee Studios came to its founding members when they were walking the streets of Houston on a hot August day. Outside of the Shake Shack on Main Street, they spotted a monkey with a guitar. With a few minutes to spare, they stopped to listen to the young fella play. As soon as they heard his smooth voice, sweet tunes, and crisp fingerpicking, their jaws dropped. They ended up listening to that monkey play till sunset. The monkey was the first artist they ever reviewed, and the reason they decided to create Street Monkee Studios.  </p>
