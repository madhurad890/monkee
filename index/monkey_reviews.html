        <p> Review: Playboi Carti must’ve been going BANANAS when he made this song… seriously! This song immediately starts hurting my head whenever it is put on. He just yells the same thing over and over again in my ears, then starts to squeak?? Very disappointed in him. I know he has better potential. My hamster Winnie instantly starts to burrow herself in a nest whenever this song comes on in my room, her little hamster hearing can’t stand it. </p>

        <h4>Album: Shrek 2 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)
        </h4>
        <h4> Song: Accidentally in Love </h4>
        <p> Song review: A classic opening song to the best movie of all time, Shrek 2. Upon first listening to this song, it was clear that it would be a timeless ballad for generations to come. Any situation calls for the soulful harmonies and relatable lyrics that “Accidentally in Love” offers. During times of joy, sadness, stress, or anger, this song can change the mood with its first drum beat. 
            Electric guitar, drums, and incredible vocals; what more could you ask for? How about a stunning visual accompaniment depicting Shrek and Fiona’s honeymoon love story? The song perfectly complements the movie, but not to worry; it stands on its own just fine.
            When Counting Crows said, “Well baby I surrender / To the strawberry ice cream / Never ever end of all this love,” fans everywhere screamed and cheered. Truer words have never been spoken. This song will surely have your nephew, grandma, and fourth-grade teacher up on their feet and shaking their behinds.

        <h4>Song: Party in the USA </h4>
        <p> Review: Fire song! Lit! Really gets you moving at parties! One time my friend and I were really sad because her boyfriend broke up with her and then I just started playing Party in The USA and she got so happy she jumped out the window and then ran to the nearest petsmart and got a hamster and named it Winnie. Anyway, long story short, it’s a great song that really puts you in a happy, nostalgic mood. But, it also seems to remind my friend of the days following her break up… which makes her sad. So happy song for most, happy for friend too, but also lil sad for her.  </p>
